What specific experience do you have building consumer facing products/features?*
Almost all of my work at Medallia, Nurx, and Leica involved consumer facing products.  

At Medallia most of the features were used primarily to manage users, organizations, and feedback.  At Nurx  I built features to assist users finding the right product for their needs by collecting information through guided surveys.  At Leica I built point cloud viewers that allowed end users to explore that data as well as annotate specific 3D views and sharing them with other uses.
