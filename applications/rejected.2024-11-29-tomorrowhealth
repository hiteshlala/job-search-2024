ABOUT TOMORROW HEALTH

Tomorrow Health enables exceptional healthcare for patients and their families in the place they want to be most — home. At Tomorrow Heath, we build technology that rewires the way home-based care is ordered, delivered, and paid for. Tomorrow Health connects patients, providers, health plans, and home-based care suppliers, to ensure patients receive the correct and timely care they need to remain healthy at home.

We believe that a team’s strength is in its people. Our goal is to raise the industry standard for patient experience, and we realize this cannot be achieved without a team that reflects the vast diversity in race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and set of experiences and perspectives of the patients we serve. We believe in putting patients first, that many perspectives are stronger than one, and in treating those we serve just as we would our own family members. If you’re passionate about improving healthcare delivery, leveraging technology to serve people, and working in a collaborative, diverse environment, we hope you’ll join us.

THE TEAM

The Engineering team at Tomorrow Health builds the technology that connects and scales the home health ecosystem in order to transform the home into the preferred place of care for positive patient outcomes. Our products serve a diverse set of users – doctors, insurance companies, medical equipment suppliers – and ultimately enable us to deliver a higher quality patient experience. Our team of mission-driven technologists is highly collaborative, supportive, empathetic, curious, and impact-oriented. We partner with the Product, Operations, and Customer Experience teams to identify opportunities to enable a faster, simpler, and more transparent process for patients and healthcare partners. 

THE ROLE 

We are currently looking for a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer with a strong focus on frontend development, who will drive and contribute to the execution, planning, and release of high-impact engineering projects. Reporting to the Engineering Manager, this person will participate in all aspects of the product development and software delivery lifecycle, focusing on raising the bar on technical quality and agility and contributing to our team's responsibility for new payors onboarding and integrations. Some examples of work you will take on:

You will transform product strategy into technical strategy by helping to develop, pilot, and iterate on several new product implementations for new and existing customers.
You will partner closely with cross-functional team members as a technical owner of key business goals.
You will embrace and champion agile development practices and execute end-to-end software development in an agile environment across our entire stack.
You will become well-versed in our testing, deployment, observability, and monitoring tools; make recommendations to improve or enhance their usage; and mentor other team members to drive an engineering culture rooted in quality and delivery.
You will mentor teammates and promote simplicity in solving complex problems across our products and teams as we scale.
ABOUT YOU

5+ years of industry experience in a software engineering role, preferably building a high-impact customer-facing product.
You are proficient in frontend technologies like React, TypeScript, NodeJS, and Redux for building responsive and intuitive user interfaces.
Experience with CSS and familiarity with component libraries & design systems.
Experience in building RESTful APIs and backend systems (we use Python and Django but seeking overall skill vs specific expertise on the backend).
You are comfortable working in a startup environment with several dynamic and concurrent projects.
Proactive technical leader, driven by a strong bias to action, ensuring initiatives move forward swiftly and effectively, yielding tangible outcomes.
BENEFITS 

100% employer-paid medical, dental and vision benefits

Fully covered membership in One Medical for on-demand primary care, and Teladoc for 24/7 virtual care

Classification of protected categories is as follows:

Why are you being asked to complete this form?
We are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.

Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.
