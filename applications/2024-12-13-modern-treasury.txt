OVERVIEW

This position can be based out of San Francisco, New York, or remote (we accept candidates from many states).

We're looking for Software Engineers to join our Engineering team. In this role, you will build innovative payments products that delight both engineering and finance teams. As an early member of the engineering team, you will help shape the engineering culture of a fast-growing startup.

The core platform at Modern Treasury sits between our customers and their banks. In the same way that Twilio abstracted away the complexity of working with communication networks, we have built an easy-to-use, common interface into the banking system. Our customers use our products to do things like move money to or from their users, automate back-office work, and record their transaction ledgers. The companies that can use Modern Treasury move over $750 trillion a year via bank payments, as compared to only $2 trillion per year on card payments.

Our API is often the most critical piece of infrastructure that our customers use. We place a premium on building robust, scalable systems that can sustain a high volume of API calls and exceed the reliability requirements to move money at scale. We complement this with well-thought out interfaces for our users and pride in writing quality API docs.

We believe in using the best tool for the job, rather than always using open source or building things ourselves. We actively embrace open source in parts of our system but aren't afraid to roll our own solution for things like writing and parsing bank files. We also contribute to open source (for example, https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/continuous-accounting-building-on-an-open-source-library).

In addition to our API, we have had a web platform since day 1 that is used by accountants, controllers, and engineers. They use our platform to do things like manage payment workflows and monitor their business. As an engineer, you will work with our product team to build products and features for these users.

ABOUT MODERN TREASURY

Modern Treasury is the operating system for money movement. Our payment operations platform combines a suite of APIs and dashboards to help companies unlock new payments revenue, strengthen customer experiences, and drive efficiency through their business. Our end-to-end platform moves enterprises forward with faster payments, efficient workflows, full data visibility, and seamless bank integrations.
