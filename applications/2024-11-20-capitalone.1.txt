If you have technical difficulties with the assessment(s), contact CodeSignal via support@codesignal.com. If you have other questions, email Careers@capitalone.com.

There were 4 questions, I ran out of time. I got 1 correct and the other halfway done.
1. given strings count the number of triplets that have only 2 vowels in them.
2. given an array of numbers find the high numbers num[i] > num[i+1] && num[i] > num[i-1] and then arrange them in order of lowest high to highest.  reducing original array each iteration.
  - got something working that passed half the tests but had to debug so moved on
3. given a matrix with an object in there and obstackesl let the object drop to its lowest point - touch edge or an obstackesl
  - got something working that passed half test
4. given 2 arrays of numbers find the longest common multiple prefixes of the numbers the two arrays.
  - got this passing all the local tests but its O(n^3) so it timed out on the full test battery.  
Ran out of time!!
