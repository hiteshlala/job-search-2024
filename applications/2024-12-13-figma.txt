Software Engineer - Billing
San Francisco, CA • New York, NY • United States
Figma is growing our team of passionate people on a mission to make design accessible to all. Born on the Web, Figma helps entire product teams brainstorm, design and build better products — from start to finish. Whether it’s consolidating tools, simplifying workflows, or collaborating across teams and time zones, Figma makes the design process faster, more efficient, and fun while keeping everyone on the same page. From great products to long-lasting companies, we believe that nothing great is made alone—come make with us!

Our Billing Team is a full stack web engineering group automating revenue workflows and building end-to-end payment and billing capabilities for all of Figma’s customers, from two-person teams to the Fortune 500. As an engineer on Billing, your contributions will play a critical role in shaping Figma's success. You will be responsible for key areas such as checkout, invoicing, customer lifecycle, pricing and packaging, and recurring billing. 

Our work is essential for Figma's continuous growth and innovation. Billing engineering plays a key role in each new product launch, and in our ability to expand into new markets, enable our sales team, and accurately report on and forecast revenue. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to leverage your existing strengths and learn new skills as the team grows and takes on new challenges.

This is a full time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.

What you'll do at Figma:
You will be a key contributor to Figma’s growth as we expand our product offering and evolve our billing model
You’ll design, build, test, and ship a smooth payment and billing experience for all of Figma’s customers using a wide variety of technologies and systems
You will work collaboratively with partners across the business to ensure accuracy in revenue reporting and forecasting, and adherence to compliance and regulatory requirements
We’d love to hear from you if you have:
5+ years of experience as a software engineer
A proven track record of building, scaling, and shipping high-quality products in high growth environments
The ability to work across the stack to craft great experiences and solve problems for customers and the business
Strong collaboration and communication skills (we’re a distributed team with a mix of hybrid and full-time remote folks)
A love of data modeling and API design problems
Strong operational excellence and ownership of the projects you lead: You test, measure, and monitor what you ship and you’re the first to notice when something is off
While it’s not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:
Experience building B2B billing solutions and/or products in the payments space
A working knowledge of revenue recognition, global tax, and/or finance concepts
Expertise with Ruby, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, and/or Snowflake
Familiarity with Stripe, Salesforce, and/or NetSuite
Experience working in complex, distributed systems with high correctness and low latency requirements
 

At Figma, one of our values is Grow as you go. We believe in hiring smart, curious people who are excited to learn and develop their skills. If you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with the points outlined in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

As a government contractor subject to the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA), we request this information in order to measure the effectiveness of the outreach and positive recruitment efforts we undertake pursuant to VEVRAA. Classification of protected categories is as follows:

A "disabled veteran" is one of the following: a veteran of the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service who is entitled to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would be entitled to compensation) under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or a person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.

Form CC-305

OMB Control Number 1250-0005

Why are you being asked to complete this form?
We are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.

Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.
