Join Frontend Frameworks at Workiva and help construct the internal frameworks that other teams build upon to make resilient and user-friendly web applications. The Frontend Architecture team owns the application shell that houses all of our products and our proprietary microfrontend framework that seamlessly integrates many independently deployed frontends. Much of this is built in the Dart language, but we’re scaling up to accelerate enablement of TypeScript as a first class frontend language at Workiva, and need an injection of TypeScript + React talent to help guide and execute our evolution.

As a Senior Frontend Engineer, you will play a central role in executing our frontend TypeScript enablement initiative by building frontend features and libraries, canonizing best practice patterns and tools, and guiding/mentoring fellow engineers in TypeScript + React development.

Through close collaboration with our talented engineering and design cohorts, you will drive the delivery of top-tier solutions that exceed our customers' expectations.

We are searching for an enthusiastic, frontend obsessed individual who relishes continual growth and is eager to grow TypeScript development across our products. If you are fueled by innovation and thrive in a collaborative setting, this role presents an exceptional opportunity to effect substantial change.
