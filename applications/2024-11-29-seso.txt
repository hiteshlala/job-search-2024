Software Engineer
Remote US
American farmers have made tremendous technology advancements through hardware improvements and investments in precision agriculture. However, when it comes to the back-office, most farms are decades behind, relying on spreadsheets, filing cabinets, and decades-old on-prem software to recruit, manage, and pay their workforce. Seso is addressing this problem by modernizing the back-office for the farm. 

Our mission is to build the premier platform for agribusiness to hire and manage their workforce and improve the lives of agricultural workers. We are addressing American farmers‚Äô biggest pain point - access to qualified labor - through a software-enabled labor solution that automates the H-2A visa. Our  comprehensive HR platform streamlines and automates the hiring process for farms and  seamlessly integrates their efforts across recruitment, onboarding, payroll, and insurance while providing workers access to financial services for the first time.

Seso has raised over $60M from Tier I investors including Index, Founders Fund, and Mary Meeker at Bond, and has been recognized with awards including Forbes Rising Stars and Andreessen Horowitz's American Dynamism 50.

About the Role
At Seso, we are passionate about building.

We focus heavily on Node.js (TypeScript), React, PostgreSQL, and Redis. Our codebase is a joy to build in - deployments (and rollbacks) are a breeze. We are obsessed with typing, tests, and iterative releases. Feature flags are a way of life. We deploy to production multiple times per day and we are only getting faster.

If these words resonate with you, you're in the right place.

Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way.
