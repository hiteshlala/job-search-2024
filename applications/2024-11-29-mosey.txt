About Mosey
Mosey makes employment compliance a breeze so fast-growing companies can hire and operate anywhere—without the administrative burden.

What's so hard about hiring people in multiple locations anyway?

Each country, state, and municipality has its own employment requirements that need to be maintained on an ongoing basis. Those requirements span HR, tax, accounting, and legal which is complicated and requires deep expertise. As a result, keeping up with the differences and the sheer volume of obligations makes hiring people in many locations expensive and painful.


You will

Build tools and automation that helps users manage employment compliance

Integrate APIs and build data pipelines

Build API endpoints to support applications and partners

Building UI/UX that help users solve their compliance problems

Design, implement and iterate new features from scratch

Help synthesize user feedback and use it to inform future development

Lay the groundwork for future engineering and product development

Set up initial infrastructure and continuous integration workflows

Work closely with the founder and founding team to build prototypes and MVPs

We're looking for someone with

5+ years of hands-on experience as a software engineer

Strong collaboration skills and excellent communication (written and verbal)

A combination of technical ability and a deep understanding of what makes a great product

Ability to solve novel problems and think critically about the best solutions

You would be a good fit if

You want your work to have a positive impact and create economic opportunity

You have experience working at a startup or led a new project from scratch

You have deep expertise in Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript and familiarity with React, FastAPI, and Postgres

You are excited about the opportunity to learn new things and go beyond engineering

You embody urgency and focus, but also have an exacting standard of quality

You like to build systems and processes from the ground up

The compensation range for this position is between $150,000 and $195,000 (plus equity) depending on experience.

Our operating principles:
Pursue knowledge

Lead with curiosity, reject bad explanations, and create objective knowledge with a tradition of conjecture and criticism.

Writing is thinking

Many seemingly good ideas don’t survive closer inspection when written down. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try, it’s precisely why you should.

Exude warmth

Build a working environment that is welcoming and supportive. Others will want to gather around you.

Be ambitious

We can do more than we think with imagination and resolve. Solving important problems requires it.

Our benefits:

Competitive compensation with material equity ownership

Health insurance including medical, dental, and vision

Mosey pays 100% of your employee premium

3 weeks vacation

8 Paid Company Holidays

Paid Family Leave

Opportunity to join a diverse, passionate, and fun team at a pivotal time in the company’s lifecycle

Remote first (continental US & Canada)


We look forward to hearing from you!
