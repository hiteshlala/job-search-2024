ABOUT THE TEAM ü§ù

Team Insight's mission is to support the personal finance features that make Rocket Money an integral part of our members‚Äô everyday financial journey. Whether it‚Äôs tracking their spending, analyzing their recurring bills and subscriptions, or managing their transactions, Team Insight‚Äôs goal is to build incredible interfaces (and the backend services that power them) that make it easy for our members to understand their financial habits.

Team Insight owns the core personal finance features that all of our members use. If you‚Äôre excited about building highly scalable features that work on the scale of millions of monthly active users, this is the team for you.

IN THIS ROLE, YOU'LL:

Work alongside a team to implement, iterate, and debug product features that drive forward both the company and the user.
Own projects from end to end, making key decisions in the implementation of new features that balance technical concerns with business concerns.
Develop with TypeScript across the stack, building user interfaces using React Native and the backend support required to power them with Node & GraphQL.
Be a steward of good user experience, ensuring that the interfaces we present our users are performant, understandable, and delightful.
Help to maintain our high technical bar, participating in code reviews and design discussions to ensure that we're applying appropriate rigor to our software development process.
Develop an understanding of our users to build and measure features which help them better understand and improve their finances.
ABOUT YOU ü¶Ñ

You have 5+ years of professional experience working with some combination of Node/TypeScript, React, GraphQL, and Postgres (or similar relational database).
You're both a student and a teacher, continually seeking to grow as an engineer and help those around you grow as well.
You're not just interested in what you're building, but also why you're building it. You want to see the bigger picture of how the software you're building is benefitting our users.
Experience with our stack (TypeScript, React Native, PostgreSQL) is a plus.
You understand observability and enjoy digging into the details to solve performance and user experience issues.
You thrive in a growing organization, and are not afraid of a challenging problem. In fact, you confront problems head on and take the lead on the solution.

If you believe you belong to any of the categories of protected veterans listed below, please indicate by making the appropriate selection. As a government contractor subject to the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA), we request this information in order to measure the effectiveness of the outreach and positive recruitment efforts we undertake pursuant to VEVRAA. Classification of protected categories is as follows:

A "disabled veteran" is one of the following: a veteran of the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service who is entitled to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would be entitled to compensation) under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or a person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.

A "recently separated veteran" means any veteran during the three-year period beginning on the date of such veteran's discharge or release from active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval, or air service.

An "active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran" means a veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized under the laws administered by the Department of Defense.

An "Armed forces service medal veteran" means a veteran who, while serving on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces service medal was awarded pursuant to Executive Order 12985.

OMB Control Number 1250-0005

Why are you being asked to complete this form?
We are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.

Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor‚Äôs Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.
