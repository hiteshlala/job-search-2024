=========================================================================================

This was a lead that Alex put me in touch with.

Jujhaar Singh - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jujhaar-singh/

We spoke briefly ~15min and it quickly became apparent that I was not a good fit.

They're relly looking for people who want to work in office 3 times a week 
and also willing to work all the time.  He didnt say that outright but that is
what he was meaning. 

My requirements of working remote and having some work life balance were the deciding
factors for both of us.

He suggested we keep in touch in case things change in the future.

Seems like a nice guy - I like that he was upfront about expectations.
