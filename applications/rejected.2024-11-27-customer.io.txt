Some Things You'll Do:

Build and refine robust web applications that simplify complex data-driven interactions into seamless user experiences.
Work closely with Product Managers, Designers, and Backend Engineers to implement features that enhance our product's functionality and user satisfaction.

Exceptional collaboration skills, with a track record of working effectively in a distributed team environment.
Passion for pushing the boundaries of web technologies to create the best possible user experience.
It would be great if you had expertise in frontend performance testing and optimization techniques, but I won’t be too greedy!

Why are you being asked to complete this form?
We are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal.

Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.

my blurb
React and Typescript.  I enjoy working with React because of its component-based architecture, which makes building and maintaining applications a lot of fun.  And I love layering TypeScript in there because it helps write better code with fewer bugs.
