About Beam

At Beam, we’re on a mission to shift $10B from brands to nonprofits by creating what loyalty would look like if it were designed for today’s customers. Last year, we grew revenue by 4.6x while also funding the prevention of >2B lbs of CO2 emissions, 7M meals for families experiencing food insecurity, 5K hrs of free therapy, and much more. 

Across our network of 250+ mission-driven brands like Tarte Cosmetics, Roots Canada, and Parade, we let you make ~1% of every purchase go to a high-impact nonprofit you choose from a curated set reflecting what the brand stands for–at no extra cost. 

As customers see how their dollars are going towards goals, like funding the removal of 10K lbs of plastic from the ocean, Beam builds emotional buy-in. We lift average order value by 15% and convert 30% more customers to make a second purchase within 90 days–far outperforming traditional loyalty, especially with millennials and Gen Z. 

Our work to help people turn their spending power into tangible impact every day has been recognized by Forbes 30 Under 30 for Social Impact, SXSW, Cannes Lions, and more.
