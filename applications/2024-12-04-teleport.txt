Senior Fullstack Engineer - Policy
United StatesEngineering – Software Engineering /Full-Time /Remote
We help companies stay secure while moving fast.

Built by engineers for engineers, The Teleport Access Platform delivers on-demand, least privileged access to infrastructure based on cryptographic identity and zero trust, with built-in identity security and policy governance, making the happy path for engineers the secure path.

Teleport is trusted by the world’s fastest-moving companies, including Elastic, Snowflake, Doordash, and NASDAQ. We recently raised US$110M at a US$1.1B valuation.

Our Vision

Today's computing environments have too much complexity, too many network boundaries, and too little trust. Complexity slows engineers down and leads to human errors. Complex systems can’t be secure despite the red tape of bureaucracy. We make trusted computing simple. This gives engineers the freedom to move and build a better future.

- It means allowing you to have the career you’ve always wanted today, rather than having to “earn your stripes” and wait for the right moment. If you’re good enough, you’re good enough.

But we don’t stop there.

In addition to the career opportunities at Teleport, we offer a whole range of benefits that help you to maximize your future, including:

Do you have what it takes?

Get to use (and know) Teleport through our unique interview process 

At Teleport, we do things a bit differently. And when we say we only hire top talent, we actually mean it. Because of this, our interview process is different too - and we’re proud of it.  We let your work do the talking. We don’t go in for six rounds of interviews, live whiteboard or live-coding. We don’t hire people that can talk a good game. We only want the best. And for that, we need to see what you can do,  in your own time, in your own way.  For real.

But interviews are a two-way street. Through the project, you’ll get a real taste of life at Teleport, including: 

- We’re flexible - you’ll have plenty of time to complete your project, if life gets in the way, that’s ok. We can - work around you. 
- We give you autonomy  - you’ll have the space and freedom to figure things out, make decisions, and problem-solve.
- We’re collaborative -  Got questions?
- We have answers. You’ll have support from your team - the one you’ll be working with day in day out if you’re successful in getting the role.
- We progress careers - During the project,  see how much you learn. That’s what working at Teleport is like. We like learning, on the job. All-the-time. 
- We can move fast (if you can) - two weeks sound like a long time? No problem? Early submissions are fine, and we’ll keep the process moving. 

Think you’ve got what it takes? We’d love to see it! Unconvinced? We can guarantee three things: 
- It’ll challenge you.
- You'll learn a lot. 
- If you love the process, you'll love working at Teleport.
