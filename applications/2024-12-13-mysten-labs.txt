Overview
Application
Mysten Labs believes that decentralized and open protocols are the bedrock of the internet of value. This is why at Mysten Labs, we are creating foundational infrastructure to accelerate the adoption of decentralized protocols based on blockchain technologies.

We're looking for a Staff Frontend Engineer to join our engineering team, and play a key role in driving the frontend vision for Mysten Labs‚Äô products.

As a Staff Engineer, you'll be a technical leader, architecting complex features, mentoring engineers, and collaborating closely with designers, product managers, and other engineers to create exceptional user experiences. In this role, you'll also help craft developer experiences by building well-documented TypeScript SDKs that empower external developers to integrate with our platform.

Key technologies we leverage:

TypeScript, React, Tailwind, Next.js, and Vite in our frontend applications.

React Native, Expo, and NativeWind for our mobile projects.

Rust, Node.js, Bun, Prisma, and Drizzle for our backend components.

We interact with our blockchain using GraphQL and JSON-RPC APIs.

What You'll Do:

Collaborate closely with product and design teams to translate product vision into reality. This includes planning, implementing, and launching core features that elevate our user experience.

Be at the forefront of exploring new frontend product areas for Sui. Your insights will help us shape future product directions.

Act as a frontend technical lead, providing mentorship and guidance to the team. You'll also play a crucial role in shaping our long-term technical strategy.

Actively engage with open source developers to contribute to the broader ecosystem and strengthen our community ties.

Work closely with dApp builders to identify pain points and continuously improve the dapp building experience on our platform.

Develop well-documented, public-facing SDKs for our network and products. These SDKs will be instrumental in enabling external developers to seamlessly integrate with our platform.

Stay up-to-date with the latest frontend trends and technologies, and participate in technical discussions and provide guidance on architectural decisions

Our ideal candidate would have:

You have 6+ years of experience in developing web apps and shipping user-facing features with JavaScript and modern, component-based JS frameworks like React.

Ability to navigate across multiple projects in a fast paced, startup environment

Excellent interpersonal communication skills and ability to partner effectively with teams in a fully remote environment and discuss complex topics with technical and non-technical audiences.

You are self-directed, innovative, and biased towards action in fast-paced environments. You love to build new things and thrive in ambiguity and even failure.

A solid understanding of how to build software components that are reusable, extensible, and modular

Familiarity with React Native is not required but is a plus.

Our team is remote first and we are hiring across the world. Here at Mysten Labs, you‚Äôll be joining a world-class team with tremendous growth potential as we bring the next billion users to web3. We raised a $300M Series B round from top Silicon Valley led venture funds like Jump Crypto, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Binance Labs, Redpoint, Lightspeed, Coinbase Ventures, Electric Capital, Standard Crypto, NFX, Slow Ventures, Scribble Ventures, Samsung Next, Lux Capital, among other investment firms and strategic partners. Come join us and build the future of web3!
