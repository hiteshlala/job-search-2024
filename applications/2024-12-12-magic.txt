Senior Web3 Software Engineer, Frontend
Remote - United States
About Magic Labs
If you‚Äôre excited about working on the forefront of chain abstraction, user experience and elevated design, we'd love for you to join our team.

Magic pioneered wallet abstraction in 2018, onboarding over 35 million wallets and 190,000 developers. We helped to create invisible wallet experiences for web3 trailblazers like Polymarket, Helium, WalletConnect and Immutable, as well as Fortune 500 brands like Forbes, Naver and Mattel. We've raised over $80 million from notable investors, including PayPal Ventures, Lightspeed, Placeholder, SV Angel, Naval Ravikant, and Balaji Srinivasan.

Today, Magic operates at the forefront of blockchain innovation, providing cutting-edge infrastructure and developer tooling to everyone building onchain. Our mission is to abstract away all technical complexity, empowering developers to create accessible end-user experiences. We believe every internet user should have access to apps and experiences onchain without the headache of traditional self-custody wallets‚Äîand the hassle of navigating siloed blockchain networks.

After setting the standard for wallet abstraction, Magic is on a mission to pioneer the next phase of abstraction: chain abstraction. With so many L1s, L2s and L3s entering the space in addition to new VMs, it‚Äôs never been more crucial to solve identity and liquidity fragmentation that spans across chains‚Äîthis is how we‚Äôll achieve true interoperability and seamless user experiences. Magic is building a unified, cross-chain network that will maximize efficiency and accessibility for developers and users alike.
