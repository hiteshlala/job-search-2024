👋 About Owner.com

Owner is the all-in-one platform that restaurants use to succeed online. 

Thousands of restaurant owners use our tools to build their website, drive online orders, create their own branded app, manage their customer relationships, and set up marketing automations. 

You can think of it as Shopify meets HubSpot, but specifically for restaurants. 

Learn more about the problems we are solving for our customers here. 

🌎 Our vision

We’re starting by helping independent restaurants succeed online.

But it’s not just restaurants that need our help. All local service-based businesses are struggling with these same problems. Huge technology corporations are taking their customers, bleeding their profits, and making it hard for them to survive.

So, once we nail the solution for restaurants – we’ll scale it into every other local business type.

In the future we envision, we’ll build the technology that tens of millions of local business owners need to succeed in the digital age.


🚀 Our traction

In just over 3 years we've generated tens of millions in revenue, served millions of guests, and have processed hundreds of millions of orders.

More importantly, we’ve helped thousands of restaurant owners save their businesses - and not  only survive, but thrive.


⭐ Our team

Our team grew from 90 people to over 150 people in 2024. We’ve got top talent from the most successful companies in SMB software like Shopify, HubSpot, DoorDash, Procore and ServiceTitan. We’ll be scaling even faster in 2025 to keep pace with our customer growth.

How we work: Owner is a remote-first, global company with a home base in San Francisco. For some of our creative teams we prioritize in-person collaboration at our SF HQ. The rest of our employees are distributed throughout the world.
