Overview

About Us:

Fieldguide is establishing a new state of trust for global commerce and capital markets through automating and streamlining the work of assurance and audit practitioners specifically within cybersecurity, privacy, and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance). Put simply, we build software for the people who enable trust between businesses. 

We’re based in San Francisco, CA, but built as a remote-first company that enables you to do your best work from anywhere. We're backed by top investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, 8VC, Y Combinator, Floodgate, Elad Gil, Justin Kan, Qasar Younis, Eric Ries, and more.

We value diversity — in backgrounds and in experiences. We need people from all backgrounds and walks of life to help build the future of audit and advisory. Fieldguide’s team is inclusive, driven, humble and supportive. We are deliberate and self-reflective about the kind of team and culture that we are building, seeking teammates that are not only strong in their own aptitudes but care deeply about supporting each other's growth.

As an early stage start-up employee, you’ll have the opportunity to build out the future of business trust. We make audit practitioners’ lives easier by eliminating up to 50% of their work and giving them better work-life balance. If you share our values and enthusiasm for building a great culture and product, you will find a home at Fieldguide.

About the Role:

We're looking for senior or above level engineers to join us. You'll have the opportunity to play a tech lead role on one of our current teams, or help with hiring and building out our next teams depending on your skills and interests. You'll also play a key role in shaping our engineering processes and culture.

This is an opportunity to join as an early engineer at a company with product-market fit that still has huge amounts of room to grow. We’re competing with legacy accounting and audit products that are 20+ years old and have negative NPS, yet do billions in sales and have seen little competition in a decade.

What You'll Do:

Be an essential technical contributor at a Series B-stage company as it scales

Play a leadership role on the end-to-end development of features, specifically in regards to making architectural decisions and trading off different approaches

Bring a mindset of continuous improvement to your work. You’ll be responsible for making our technology and processes better over time.

Understand how to optimize for iteration speed while maintaining a high quality bar and technical rigor


‍You’ll need to have experience with several of the following:

Modern web tech stacks consisting of several of the following: TypeScript, React, GraphQL, NodeJS, Hasura, Postgres, and AWS

Architecting systems and data pipelines that can handle the ingestion, digitalization, storage, and retrieval of document-heavy data sets, including document processing, search, and classification (ML experience is a plus)

Test and automation tools like Jest and Cypress

DevOps and continuous integration/delivery best practices

Information security best practices

Collaborating on all aspects of product strategy and UX

Shaping a young tech stack, product, and engineering organization

‍
