Software Engineer II, Full Stack (Financial Engines)
United States, Remote
hi-logo

Human Interest is on a mission to ensure that people in all lines of work have access to retirement benefits. 

Nearly half of all working Americans are not saving enough for their future. Too often it’s because they are employed by a company that doesn’t offer a retirement plan. Human Interest is changing that by making it affordable and accessible for small and medium-sized businesses to offer employees a path to financial independence through retirement savings.

We’re a high-growth tech company changing the retirement industry. We’ve raised more than $700M in primary and secondary financings and are backed by a number of investors. Most recently, this includes funding from Marshall Wace and Baillie Gifford, as well as top investors such as BlackRock, TPG (The Rise Fund), SoftBank, Glynn Capital, NewView Capital, USVP, Wing, Uncork, and more.

Are you ready to join our amazing engineering team?

As an engineering organization, we seek to redefine the retirement services space with software that drives toward an effortless, efficient, scalable and highly reliable cloud based experience. Joining our team requires passion for ownership - after all, this is what enables our users’ success. 

How we do it: 

We value continuous improvement - we care about documentation, security, durability, not just throwing features over the wall.
We help each other be better engineers - we leave things better than we found it.
We aspire to collaborate seamlessly - we ensure our software is improving the customer experience

Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability
Form CC-305
Page 1 of 1
OMB Control Number 1250-0005
Expires 04/30/2026

Why are you being asked to complete this form?
We are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.

Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.
